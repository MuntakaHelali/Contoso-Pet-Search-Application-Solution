# Contoso-Pet-Search-Application-Solution
The Contoso Pets Application is used to find homes for stray or abandoned dogs and cats. The application already had the main menu design and functionality completed. Option 2 from the menu was completed using iteration statements, user input, formatting of data, coversion of data types, manipulation and sorting arrays, modifying and building complex strings from multiple data sources. Using iteration, and threading the searching animation was improved to match the new functionality for Option 2. 

Option 1 allows the users to see all the pets that are currently part of the Contoso Pet Adoption Center Database. 
Option 2 is the feature that allows the user to search for multiple terms for "dog" pets that are currently in the database that users can look to adopt.
